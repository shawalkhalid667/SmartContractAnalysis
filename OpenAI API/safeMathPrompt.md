## Prompt for SafeMath Smart Contract:

SafeMath Smart Contract:
Develop a Solidity smart contract named "SafeMathContract" to incorporate the SafeMath operations for safe math calculations.
The contract will include SafeMath functions for multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition to ensure secure arithmetic operations.

SafeMath Operations:

Implement the SafeMath functions from the SafeMath library within the SafeMathContract smart contract.
Ensure that the multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition functions perform safety checks to prevent overflow and underflow errors.

SafeMath32 and SafeMath16 Integration:

Extend the SafeMath functionality to uint32 and uint16 data types within the SafeMathContract smart contract.
Incorporate SafeMath32 and SafeMath16 operations for uint32 and uint16 math calculations to cover a wider range of data types.

Error Handling and Validation:

Include robust error handling mechanisms in the smart contract functions to handle potential arithmetic issues and enforce data validation.
Implement checks to ensure that safe math operations are conducted accurately and securely to prevent vulnerabilities.

Security Measures and Gas Efficiency:

Emphasize the importance of security measures in the Smart Contract to safeguard against common vulnerabilities in Solidity code.
Optimize the SafeMath operations for gas efficiency to reduce transaction costs and enhance the overall performance of the Smart Contract.

Testing and Deployment:

Thoroughly test the SafeMathContract smart contract to verify the correctness and safety of the math operations.
Prepare the Smart Contract for deployment on the Ethereum blockchain to enable secure and reliable math computations.

Functionality and Usage:

Outline the functionality of the SafeMathContract and its role in providing safe math operations for various data types.
Provide usage instructions for interacting with the Smart Contract to perform secure arithmetic calculations on the blockchain.

Quality Assurance and Best Practices:

Follow best practices in Solidity development to ensure clean, readable, and efficient code within the SafeMathContract.

Adhere to industry-standard security guidelines and conduct quality assurance checks to maintain the integrity of the Smart Contract.
