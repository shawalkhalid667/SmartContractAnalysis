## SafeMath Contract:

Implement a SafeMath library for performing math operations with safety checks to throw on error.
Include functions for multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition of uint256 numbers.

## SafeMath32 Library:

Develop a SafeMath32 library to extend SafeMath functionality for uint32 data type.
Implement functions for mul, div, sub, and add operations specific to uint32 numbers.

## SafeMath16 Library:

Create a SafeMath16 library to further extend SafeMath capabilities for uint16 data type.
Define functions for multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition tailored for uint16 numbers.

## Math Operations:

Include functions in each library to handle multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition with appropriate safety checks.

##Error Handling:

Perform sanity checks in each function to prevent overflow and ensure accurate math operations.
Throw errors in case of invalid inputs or incorrect calculations.

## Functionality:

Ensure that multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition operations are performed accurately and securely for each data type.

## Library Structure:

Define the necessary internal functions in each library to support mathematical operations based on the data type.

##Usage:

Provide an overview of how each library can be used to perform math operations safely and efficiently in Solidity smart contracts.

##Testing:

Test each library function thoroughly to validate the accuracy of math operations and error handling mechanisms.

##Deployment:

Once the libraries are tested and validated, they can be deployed for use in Solidity smart contracts to ensure secure and reliable math computations.

##Quality Assurance:

Ensure that the libraries adhere to best practices for secure coding and are optimized for gas efficiency in Ethereum smart contracts.
