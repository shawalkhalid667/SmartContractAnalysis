# SmartContractAI-Comparison

This repository hosts a research project focused on smart contract generation and comparison between various generative AI tools. Smart contracts, self-executing agreements on the blockchain, have transformed agreement execution and management, but their development presents challenges such as coding complexity, vulnerabilities, and auditing difficulties. This project explores the efficiency, accessibility, and innovation aspects of smart contract development using generative AI tools. Through a comparative study, we evaluate the effectiveness of tools like ChainGPT, BardAI, and ChatGPT in automating coding tasks, reducing manual efforts, and ensuring consistency and security in smart contract creation. The research aims to accelerate smart contract development, make it accessible to individuals without programming backgrounds, and foster a culture of creativity in the blockchain ecosystem.
