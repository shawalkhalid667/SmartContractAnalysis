- **Block Timestamp:**
  - Use of "block.timestamp" can be influenced by miners to a certain degree, potentially changing the outcome of a transaction.
- **Gas Costs:**
  - Gas requirement of function `TotlePrimary.performSwapCollection` is infinite.
- **For Loops Over Dynamic Array:**
  - Loops that do not have a fixed number of iterations should be used carefully due to the block gas limit. Test the maximum number of items to pass to such functions.
- **Constant/View/Pure Functions:**
  - `TokenTransferProxy.transferFrom` potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not.
- **Similar Variable Names:**
  - Variables have very similar names in various functions.
- **No Return:**
  - `TokenTransferProxy.transferFrom` defines a return type but never explicitly returns a value.
- **Guard Conditions:**
  - Use "assert(x)" if you never want x to be false, and "require(x)" if x can be false due to invalid input or a failing external component.
