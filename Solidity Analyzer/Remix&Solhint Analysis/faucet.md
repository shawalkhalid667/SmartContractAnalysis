- **Check-effects-interaction:**
  - Potential violation of Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern in `Migrations.upgrade(address)`: Could potentially lead to re-entrancy vulnerability. Note: Modifiers are currently not considered by this static analysis.
  - Gas requirement of function `Migrations.setCompleted` is infinite: If the gas requirement of a function is higher than the block gas limit, it cannot be executed. Please avoid loops in your functions or actions that modify large areas of storage (this includes clearing or copying arrays in storage).
  - Guard conditions: Use "assert(x)" if you never ever want x to be false, not in any circumstance (apart from a bug in your code). Use "require(x)" if x can be false, due to e.g. invalid input or a failing external component.

#### Solhint
- Compiler version ^0.8.0 does not satisfy the ^0.5.8 semver requirement.
- Variable name must be in mixedCase.
- Error message for require is too long.
- Explicitly mark visibility in function (Set ignoreConstructors to true if using solidity >=0.7.0).
