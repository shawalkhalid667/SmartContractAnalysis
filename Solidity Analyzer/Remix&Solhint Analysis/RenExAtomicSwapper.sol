- **Block Timestamp:**
  - Use of "block.timestamp": "block.timestamp" can be influenced by miners to a certain degree, potentially leading to changes in the outcome of a transaction.
- **Gas Costs:**
  - Gas requirement of function `RenExAtomicSwapper.VERSION` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `RenExAtomicSwapper.initiate` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `RenExAtomicSwapper.redeem` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `RenExAtomicSwapper.audit` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `RenExAtomicSwapper.auditSecret` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `RenExAtomicSwapper.swapID` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `RenExAtomicSwapper.withdrawal` is infinite.
- **Constant/View/Pure Functions:**
  - `RenExAtomicSwapper.swapID(address,address,uint256,bytes32,uint256)` is constant but potentially should not be.
- **Similar Variable Names:**
  - Variables have very similar names in functions `RenExAtomicSwapper.initiate` and `RenExAtomicSwapper.swapID`.
  - Variables have very similar names in functions `RenExAtomicSwapper.audit` and `RenExAtomicSwapper.swapID`.
- **Guard Conditions:**
  - Use "assert(x)" if you never ever want x to be false. Use "require(x)" if x can be false due to e.g. invalid input or a failing external component.
