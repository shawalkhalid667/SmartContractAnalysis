### wethDeposit.sol

#### Chat GPT Contract

#### Remix
- **Check-Effects-Interaction:**
  - Potential violation of Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern in `WethDeposit.(address,address)`, which could lead to a re-entrancy vulnerability.
- **Gas Costs:**
  - Gas requirement of function `WethDeposit.weth` is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function `WethDeposit.exchange` is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function `WethDeposit.deposit` is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function `WethDeposit.withdraw` is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
- **Constant/View/Pure Functions:**
  - `WETH.approve(address,uint256)` and `Exchange.user_deposit_to_session(uint64,uint32,uint256)` potentially should be constant/view/pure but are not.
- **No Return:**
  - `WETH.approve(address,uint256)` defines a return type but never explicitly returns a value.
- **Guard Conditions:**
  - Use "assert(x)" if you never want x to be false, except for bugs. Use "require(x)" if x can be false due to invalid input or failing external components.

#### Solhint
- Compiler version ^0.8.0 does not satisfy the ^0.5.8 semver requirement.
- Function name must be in mixedCase.
- Variable name must be in mixedCase.
- Explicitly mark visibility in function (Set ignoreConstructors to true if using solidity >=0.7.0).
- Error message for require is too long.
- Avoid using low level calls.

- **Check-Effects-Interaction:**
  - Potential violation of Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern in `WethDeposit.(address,address)`, which could lead to a re-entrancy vulnerability.
- **Low Level Calls:**
  - Use of "call" should be avoided whenever possible. It can lead to unexpected behavior if the return value is not handled properly. Please use Direct Calls via specifying the called contract's interface.

  - Gas requirement of function `WethDeposit.wethToken` is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.

- Global import of path `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol` and `@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol` is not allowed. Specify names to import individually or bind all exports of the module into a name (import "path" as Name).
