- **Gas Costs:**
  - Gas requirement of function MyToken.name is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function MyToken.symbol is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function MyToken.allowance is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function MyToken.transfer is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function MyToken.approve is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function MyToken.transferFrom is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
- **Constant/View/Pure Functions:**
  - IERC20.transfer(address,uint256), IERC20.approve(address,uint256), and IERC20.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) potentially should be constant/view/pure but are not.
- **No Return:**
  - IERC20.totalSupply(), IERC20.balanceOf(address), IERC20.allowance(address,address), IERC20.transfer(address,uint256), IERC20.approve(address,uint256), and IERC20.transferFrom(address,address,uint256) define a return type but never explicitly return a value.
- **Guard Conditions:**
  - Use "assert(x)" if you never want x to be false, except for bugs. Use "require(x)" if x can be false due to invalid input or failing external components.

#### Solhint
- Compiler version ^0.8.0 does not satisfy the ^0.5.8 semver requirement.
- Explicitly mark visibility in function (Set ignoreConstructors to true if using solidity >=0.7.0).
- Error message for require is too long.

#### ChainGPT
- Does not compile.
