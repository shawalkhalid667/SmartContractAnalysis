### bancroX.sol

#### ChatGPT Contract

#### Remix
- **Selfdestruct:**
  - Use of selfdestruct can block calling contracts unexpectedly, especially if this contract is planned to be used by other contracts.
- **Gas Costs:**
  - Gas requirement of function BancorX.lockTokens is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function BancorX.releaseTokens is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function BancorX.initiateXTransfer is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function BancorX.submitReport is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function BancorX.configureSettings is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
- **Guard Conditions:**
  - Use "assert(x)" if you never want x to be false, except for bugs. Use "require(x)" if x can be false due to invalid input or failing external components.
- **Delete from Dynamic Array:**
  - Using "delete" on an array leaves a gap. If you want to remove the empty position, you need to shift items manually and update the "length" property.

#### Solhint
- Compiler version ^0.8.0 does not satisfy the ^0.5.8 semver requirement.
- Global imports of paths @openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol and @openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol are not allowed. Specify names to import individually or bind all exports of the module into a name.
- Error message for require is too long.
- Explicitly mark visibility in function (Set ignoreConstructors to true if using solidity >=0.7.0).
- Variable "token" is unused.

#### ChainGPT Contract
- Does not compile.
