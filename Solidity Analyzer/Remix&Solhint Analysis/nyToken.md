- **Gas Costs:**
  - Gas requirement of function NYToken.name is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function NYToken.symbol is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function NYToken.transfer is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function NYToken.transferFrom is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function NYToken.approve is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function NYToken.allowance is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
- **Constant/View/Pure functions:**
  - Potentially constant/view/pure functions should be marked accordingly.
- **No Return:**
  - Define a return type explicitly for functions that never return a value.
- **Guard Conditions:**
  - Use "assert(x)" if you never want x to be false, except for bugs. Use "require(x)" if x can be false due to invalid input or failing external components.
- **Data Truncated:**
  - Division of integer values yields an integer value again. Ensure correct data handling for division operations.
