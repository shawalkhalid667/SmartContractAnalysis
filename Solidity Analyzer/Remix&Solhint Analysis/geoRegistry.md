- **Gas Costs:**
  - Gas requirement of function GeoRegistry.createZone is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function GeoRegistry.activateZone is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function GeoRegistry.isSubZone is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function GeoRegistry.batchAddSubZones is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
  - Gas requirement of function GeoRegistry.isValidGeohash is infinite, potentially exceeding the block gas limit. Avoid loops in functions or actions that modify large storage areas.
- **For Loop over Dynamic Array:**
  - Loops that do not have a fixed number of iterations, such as loops dependent on storage values, should be used carefully to avoid exceeding the block gas limit.
- **Guard Conditions:**
  - Use "assert(x)" if you never want x to be false, except for bugs. Use "require(x)" if x can be false due to invalid input or failing external components.

#### Solhint
- Compiler version ^0.8.0 does not satisfy the ^0.5.8 semver requirement.
- Variable "geohash" is unused.

#### ChainGPT
- Exact same analysis for both.
