- **Gas costs:**
  - Gas requirement of function `SODA.borrow` is infinite: If the gas requirement of a function is higher than the block gas limit, it cannot be executed. Please avoid loops in your functions or actions that modify large areas of storage (this includes clearing or copying arrays in storage).
  - Gas requirement of function `SODA.setRate` is infinite: If the gas requirement of a function is higher than the block gas limit, it cannot be executed. Please avoid loops in your functions or actions that modify large areas of storage (this includes clearing or copying arrays in storage).
- **Constant/View/Pure functions:**
  - `SODA.repay(uint256)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not. Note: Modifiers are currently not considered by this static analysis.
  - `SODA.liquidate()`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not. Note: Modifiers are currently not considered by this static analysis.
  - `SODA.__callback(bytes32,uint256)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not. Note: Modifiers are currently not considered by this static analysis.
  - `SODA._borrow(address,uint256,uint256)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not. Note: Modifiers are currently not considered by this static analysis.
  - `SODA._liquidate(address)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not. Note: Modifiers are currently not considered by this static analysis.
  - `SODA.setRate(uint256)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not. Note: Modifiers are currently not considered by this static analysis.
- **No return:**
  - `SODA.interestAmount(uint256,uint256)`: Defines a return type but never explicitly returns a value.
- **Guard conditions:**
  - Use "assert(x)" if you never ever want x to be false, not in any circumstance (apart from a bug in your code). Use "require(x)" if x can be false, due to e.g. invalid input or a failing external component.
