### VendingMachine.sol

#### Chat GPT Contract

#### Remix
- **Check-effects-interaction:**
  - Potential violation of Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern in `VendingMachine.withdraw(uint256)`. Could potentially lead to re-entrancy vulnerability. Note: Modifiers are currently not considered by this static analysis.
- **Gas Costs:**
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.deposit` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.withdraw` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.adminMint` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.sweep` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.addAdmin` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.removeAdmin` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.addWhitelisted` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.removeWhitelisted` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.addVendor` is infinite.
  - Gas requirement of function `VendingMachine.addProduct` is infinite.
- **Constant/View/Pure Functions:**
  - `Roles.add(struct Roles.Role,address)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not.
  - `Roles.remove(struct Roles.Role,address)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not.
  - `VendingMachine.addAdmin(address)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not.
  - `VendingMachine.removeAdmin(address)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not.
  - `VendingMachine.addWhitelisted(address)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not.
  - `VendingMachine.removeWhitelisted(address)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not.
- **Similar Variable Names:**
  - Variables have very similar names in functions `VendingMachine.addVendor(uint256,string,address)` and `VendingMachine.addProduct(uint256,uint256,string,uint256,bool)`.

#### Solhint
- Compiler version ^0.8.0 does not satisfy the ^0.5.8 semver requirement.
- Explicitly mark visibility in function (Set ignoreConstructors to true if using solidity >=0.7.0).

#### Chain GPT Contract
- Does not compile.
