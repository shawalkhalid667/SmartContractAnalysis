# Contract Analysis Summary for TransferHelper.sol

This document provides a summary of issues highlighted by the Remix Analyzer and solhint plugin for the TransferHelper.sol smart contract files.

## Remix Analyzer

### TransferHelper.sol Contract 
- **Check-effects-interaction:** Potential violation of Checks-Effects-Interaction pattern in `TransferHelper.safeApprove(address,address,uint256)` at line 5 and `TransferHelper.safeTransfer(address,address,uint256)` at line 14 and `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(address,address,address,uint256)` at line 23. This could potentially lead to re-entrancy vulnerability.
- **Low level calls:** Use of "call" should be avoided whenever possible. It can lead to unexpected behavior if return value is not handled properly. Please use Direct Calls via specifying the called contract's interface. Detected at lines 6, 15, 24, and 34.
- **Guard conditions:** Advises using `assert(x)` if you never ever want x to be false, and `require(x)` if x can be false, due to e.g. invalid input or a failing external component. Detected at lines 11, 20, 30, and 35.
